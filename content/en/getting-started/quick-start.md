## Step 1: Install NavCoin


## Step 2: Choose your network

NavCoin has four blockchains that you can choose to sync with:

- Mainnet
- Testnet
- Devnet
- Regtest

Each of these networks has a different purpose, to read about what they are for and how they co-exist, see [navcoin-networks]

For this quick start guide we will assume you want to connect to the Testnet.

## Step 3: Connect to the Test Network and sync the blockchain


## Step 4: Run an RPC command from the console


## Step 5: Run an RPC command using Postman
