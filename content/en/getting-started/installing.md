{{% note %}}
While compiling NavCoin from source is great, it's not for everyone. You can always grab a precompiled binary from [github](https://github.com/NAVCoin/navcoin-core/releases/latest).
{{% /note %}}

NavCoin is forked off of the Bitcoin v0.13 codebase and is thus written in C++ with a QT frontend. 
The latest release can be found at the project's [github repository](https://github.com/NAVCoin/navcoin-core/releases/latest).

NavCoin currently provides pre-built binaries for the following:

* macOS, for 64bit.
* Windows, 32bit and 64bit.
* Linux, 32bit and 64bit.
* ARM Linux
* i686 Linux

NavCoin may also be compiled from source using .

## Quick Install
